'''
3-10. Every Function: Think of things you could store in a list. For example, you
could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything
else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items and
then uses each function introduced in this chapter at least once.
pop() - Removes the last item in the index
append() -  Inserts the an item to the end of a list
len() - counts the length of the list 
insert - insert item into a list at a specific point of the index
del - permanently deletes an item from a list
title() 
reverse() - Changes the list permanently
sorted() - Does not change the list, organizes in alphabetical 
sorted(reverse = True) - Does not change the list, reverse alphabetical order
sort - changes the list permanently and puts it in alphabetical order
